    "What problems can causalml solve?\n",
    "- Targeting optimization\n",
    "    - We can use CausalML to target promotions to those with the biggest incrementality. For example, at a cross-sell marketing campaign for existing customers, we can deliver promotions to the customers who would be more likely to use a new product specifically given the exposure to the promotions, while saving inboxes for others. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Causal impact analysis\n",
    "    - We can also use CausalML to analyze the causal impact of a particular event from experimental or observational data, incorporating rich features. For example, we can analyze how a customers cross-sell event affects long term spending on the platform. In this case, it is impractical to set up a randomized test because we do not want to exclude any customers from being able to convert to the new product. Utilizing CausalML, we can run various ML-based causal inference algorithms, and estimate the impact of the cross-sell on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Personalization\n",
    "    - CausalML can be used to personalize engagement. There are multiple options for a company to interact with its customers, such as different product choices in up-sell or messaging channels for communications. One can use CausalML to estimate the effect of each combination for each customer, and provide optimal personalized offers to customers."
